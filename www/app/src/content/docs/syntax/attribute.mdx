:::note
Attributes in HMPL are related to [block helpers](/syntax/block-helper). When considering this concept, we recommend reading the page about them first.
:::

## What is this?

These are some parameters that we set for block helpers in order to customize their work for our needs. For example, if we want to link our layout with javascript, then without attributes it will be problematic to specify which of the numerous block helpers to apply, for example, HMPLRequestInit and other points.

```hmpl
{{#request
  src="/api/hello"
  after="submit:#form"
  repeat=false
}}{{/request}}
```

It is worth considering that JSON5 is also used for parsing attributes. If you write a complex structure that passes in JavaScript, for example, for an object, then for JSON5 it may not pass (comments and so on).

## Structure

An attribute consists of a **key** and a **value**, just like in regular HTML, but with some exceptions. An attribute consists of a key and a value, just like in regular HTML, but with a few exceptions. In HMPL, there is a key, which is the string (`src` as an example), followed by an equals symbol `=`, and then the value itself.

```hmpl
{{#request
  attr1="Text1"
  attr2=["Text2", "Text3"]
  attr3=true
  attr4={
    foo: "bar"
  }
  attr5=1
}}{{/request}}
```

The following types are supported in values: `string`, `array`, `boolean`, `object` and `number`.

## Peculiarities

Some attributes can be overwritten in block helpers. So, for example, if you write indicators as an attribute, and then specify nested indicators.

## External attribute values

Since version 3.2.0, the template language now supports the ability to create constructs with double quotes outside of block helpers. Now, tag attributes can specify names that are functionally related to server requests.

```hmpl
<div class="{{requestStatus}} text">Some text</div>
{{#request
  src="/api/hello"
  after="submit:#form"
  repeat=false
  bind="{{requestStatus}}"
}}{{/request}}
```
